# anime-pictures.net-downloader
It's a small pc program for automatic downloading anime pictures from the website https://anime-pictures.net

There are 5 ways to download pictures:
  1. From first page (enter number of pages to download on one page is 80 pictures)
  2. From-to page (you select start and end page you want to download)
  3. Number pictures from the first page (enter number pictures you want to download from the first page)
  4. Number of pages and number of pictures (enter the number of start page and enter the number of pictures you want to download)
  5. Search (you enter what you want if it's own website you can download it and type how many pictures you want to download and if you type a bigger number then it downloads maximum)
If you have some ideas about what you want to add to this program or have some issues type it here https://github.com/RishaBarCZ/anime-pictures.net-downloader/issues

I hope that this program will be helpful for you :)))
